Upgrade this file to the latest Angular version:

```html
<body>
    <app-nav-menu></app-nav-menu>
    <div class="container">
        <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </div>
</body>
```

Since the original file contents are already up-to-date and do not require any modifications, there is no need to change the code.
